# Introduction

Welcome! Graphics Guide is an [open source](https://github.com/realandrew/graphics_guide) website that attempts to real-time graphics concepts using modern approaches. It also serves as a central hub for my API specific graphics guides:

* [Vulkan Guide](https://vulkanguide.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/realandrew/vulkan_guide)
* [OpenGL Guide](https://openglguide.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/realandrew/opengl_guide)
* [DirectX Guide](https://directxguide.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/realandrew/directx_guide)

This site is currently a placeholder. I plan to start working on in the next few years, but currently my effort is being put into my [Vulkan Guide](https://vulkanguide.com/).
